XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a versatile and platform-independent text format used to create and structure data through custom-defined tags, enabling both human-readable and machine-readable documents. It features a hierarchical structure, allowing for complex data representation and is extensively used for data exchange between systems, configuration files, document storage, and data serialization. XML's flexibility in defining tags makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, such as web services and APIs, ensuring seamless data interchange across different platforms and software environments.
